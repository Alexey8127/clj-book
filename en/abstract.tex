In this book, I tell about Clojure which is a modern dialect of Lisp.
Clojure is a functional programming  language that emphasizes immutability and multithreading.
It was designed ten years ago, and now it's gradually getting popular (in Russia).
The seven chapters look at using ~Clojure in~production.

% Эта книга не для тех, кто учит язык с нуля.

If you read this book, I assume that you have some knowledge of Clojure or other Lisps.
You will better understand the material if you have programming experience. This book is geared to advanced readers.
